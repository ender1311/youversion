    <p>Look around and you'll quickly see that our world is filled with instability and uncertainty. Every day seems to bring with it another disheartening news headline or unanswered question. In the midst of life's struggles, how do we hold onto hope?</p>
    <p class="fix_eyes">We fix our eyes on Jesus.</p>

    <p>God promises that He will never leave us or forsake us. As we seek His heart, we find hope for our souls and strength to face whatever is in front of us. Our situation may not change, but when we spend time in God's Word, our perspective shifts.</p>

        <p>When you call on me, <br>
        when you come and pray to me, I'll listen.</p>
        <p>Jeremiah 29:12</p>
